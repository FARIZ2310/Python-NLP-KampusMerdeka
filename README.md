# ðŸš€ NLP Chatbot for Campus Locations ðŸš€

During Kampus Merdeka Batch 3 at Synthesis Academy (2022), my team and I developed a Natural Language Processing (NLP) chatbot designed to help users easily find various locations on our campus. This project was a collaboration between 3 team members, where we integrated AI to provide an intuitive, conversational interface for campus visitors or students to inquire about specific locations and receive accurate information.

Key highlights of the project:

NLP Integration: Utilizing Natural Language Processing to allow the chatbot to understand and respond to user queries.
Campus Location Mapping: Providing detailed directions and information about key places on campus, such as buildings, departments, and facilities.
Team Collaboration: Working closely in a team of three, ensuring smooth project development from design to deployment.
This project enhanced my skills in NLP and chatbot development, as well as teamwork and collaboration.
